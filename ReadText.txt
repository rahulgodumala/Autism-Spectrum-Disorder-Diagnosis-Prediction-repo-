NOTE2: Instead of taking genetic algorithm for training we are taking NN


### To find or to differentiate accuracies of different classifiers and methods (run in "jupyter (tsf)") ###

1) run "heart_disease_prediction.ipynb" file  for rf.pkl model creation

### Operations (run in "spyder (tsf)") ###
2) run "Diabetes Predictor.py" file for  for diabetes-prediction-rfc-model.pkl model creation

# dont create model if model.pkl is already present

### Operations (run in "spyder (tsf)") ###

1) DONT run "h5 model creation.py" file for heart.h5 model creation
# dont create model if model.h5 is already present


### Main file (run in "spyder (tsf)") ###

1) run "app.py" file to implement main operation
